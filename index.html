    <h3> Here's a simple example of HTML and CSS working together</h3>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the backbone of web content, giving structure to text, images, and other elements on a webpage. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), on the other hand, is what brings that content to life visually. While HTML might say “this is a heading” or “this is a paragraph,” CSS decides how that heading looks—its color, size, spacing, and even animations. Together, they create the balance of form and function: HTML builds the house, and CSS picks the paint, curtains, and mood lighting. This dynamic duo is the foundation of modern web design, enabling developers to craft sites that are both useful and beautiful. Want an example of them working hand-in-hand? I’d be happy to whip one up.</p>
